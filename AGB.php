                <br />
                  <strong class="suptitxt">Agreement between Swiss Travels GmbH&rsquo;s its  Clients</strong><br />
                A contract  between Swiss Travels GmbH and its clients can be arranged through a written  form, telephone or personal booking but officially it begins when the clients  make a deposit or full payment of the travel-tour arrangement. Paying a deposit  or full payment is the confirmation that the clients also agree with the terms  and conditions of Swiss Travels GmbH and its suppliers.<br />
                <br />
  <strong class="suptitxt">Products and suppliers</strong> <br />
                We provide  different varieties of travel and tour products from different suppliers, service  providers andour own products. In addition to our general terms and conditions,  each supplier has their terms and conditions which are applicable to your travel  and tour arrangements. Swiss Travels GmbH is also acting as a booking agent (e.g.  air carriage, hotels, car rental, ground transportation, transfer etc.). In  such products clients will be entering into separate terms and conditions with  suppliers in connection with travel-tour arrangements. We have no contractual  liability where we act as agents, and provide no warranties of suitability  andquality of their travel-tour products. </p>
              <p><strong class="suptitxt">Airline Tickets </strong><br />

                Swiss  Travels GmbH functions as an agent for airline tickets. The prices of the  committed purchased tickets&rsquo; prices canincrease due to the government or  supplier&rsquo;s additional costsor fuel surcharges, fare increases,taxes or  fluctuation in the foreign currency markets. In case of any price increase,  Swiss Travels GmbH has the right to increase the committed prices. To avoid being  affected by any price increase we recommend our clients to make the payment on  due time and purchase the tickets. <br />
